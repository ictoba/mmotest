Trying to implement some sort of multiplayer game

# Technologies used:
- [uWebSockets.js](https://github.com/uNetworking/uWebSockets.js/) for server networking
- [SirDez](https://github.com/weisrc/sirdez) for binary serialization of packets sent over the network
- [@math.gl/core](https://github.com/uber-web/math.gl) for math primitives

# License
The code written by me is public domain software, but the rendering part was stolen from [Mozilla WebGL samples](https://github.com/mdn/dom-examples/tree/main/webgl-examples) so check the license for that code.
